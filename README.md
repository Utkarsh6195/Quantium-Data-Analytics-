## Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program

#Overview
This repository contains my work for the Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program offered through Forage. The program provided hands-on experience in data analysis, focusing on customer analytics and store trial evaluation using R and Python.

#Tasks

#Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
Objective: Analyze customer purchasing trends and behaviors to provide strategic recommendations for category review.
Key Steps:
Data cleaning and high-level summaries.
Identification and removal of outliers.
Derivation of key metrics such as pack size and brand name.
Segmentation of customers based on purchasing behavior.
Results: Insights into customer segments and their chip purchasing behavior, forming the basis for strategic recommendations.

#Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
Objective: Evaluate the performance of a store trial in stores 77, 86, and 88 by comparing them to control stores.
Key Steps:
Calculation of monthly sales metrics: total sales revenue, total number of customers, and average number of transactions per customer.
Selection of control stores using Pearson correlations and magnitude distance.
Comparison of trial and control stores during the trial period.
Statistical testing to identify significant differences in total sales and the drivers of change.
Results: Detailed evaluation of the store trial, highlighting the impact on sales and customer behavior.
